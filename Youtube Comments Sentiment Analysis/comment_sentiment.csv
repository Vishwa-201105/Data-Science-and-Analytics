Aren't cities like Miami already having this happen? 
Also, isn't it true that recessions due often trigger lower interest rates, but that tariffs are going to increase inflation which will prevent interest rates from going down? If we had a ""typical"" recession, I'd agree with you, but it seems like lowering the interest rate here would just make prices skyrocket. So you just run into the same affordability problem of the buyer... they'r enow going to have to pay 20% more for their house with a 1% lower mortgage interest rate. Which because we're in a recession, wages will not go up and that will make housing even less affordable.

Everyone knows by now that Trump is Bannon's puppet, and Bannon is driving the Tariff ship while Trump is saying stupid things as smoke and mirrors and declaring many of his enemies, enemies of the state with the stoke of his pen, including law firms to make it look more chaotic. Trump is even already declaring a third term just to yank some chains while he lets Bannon figure out his next move. Meanwhile people are losing jobs (because those trillion-dollar jobs you believe Trump made, you're going to have to show the actual proof of and not like Elon did by just declare it to be true) losing their retirements and their savings. Right now there is only uncertainty, the possibility of a recession and buyer remorse while there is almost four years of this to come.

z9eGjvozo1I,"anyways heres how to make beef wellington 

Step 1
Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper.
Step 2
Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.
Step 4
To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and season with salt and pepper. Cook until liquid has evaporated and mixture is sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool in fridge. Step 5
Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it‚Äôs twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Arrange the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that‚Äôs big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto.
Step 6
Place tenderloin at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).
Step 7
Heat oven to 425¬∞. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry. Step 8
Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.
Step 9
Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and score lightly with a sharp knife. Sprinkle with flaky salt.
Step 10
Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120¬∞F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 20 minutes before carving and serving.",0.03775279247501469

ZIVpSUgQSHY,"I wish you would have explained the background for capping the SALT tax at $10,000. 

1) The states with the highest taxes are blue Democrat states.  These states continued to raise taxes year over year. The state government received less push back from constituents because they could deduct this amount from their Federal taxes.  Citizens living in states with no (or lower) state income taxes (majority red Republican states) did not benefit from this Federal deduction. Why should citizens in states that are more efficient and manage their money better pay more in Federal taxes? Without a SALT cap, there is less incentive for states to manage state money better.
2) Persons with more expensive homes and bigger home loans get a bigger mortgage interest reduction which reduces Federal income taxes paid. Why should wealthier persons pay less in Federal taxes than those persons that make less.
3) In order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, you must have a mortgage. Who benefits from a mortgage? Banks and lenders. There is less benefit financially to paying off the mortgage and getting out of debt. Our economy is based on consumer spending and borrowing (versus manufacturing).

But anyway not only did Harley survive but Japan got innovative and focused on producing way more 700cc and smaller motorcycles and obviously buyers are not going to want less powerful bikes so the Japanese figured out how to get 750 level power from 650s and 700s inspiring higher performance engine development to where now 600cc engines are making more HP than older 1000cc engines.
