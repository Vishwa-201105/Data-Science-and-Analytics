Which means they are saving 30,40 millions
But poor or middle class is saving a LOT LESS from tax cut off
And also theres now price hike cuz of tariffs, and yet they still voted for trump

China is so much of a different economic beast than in most other US recession times and Trump's ""America First"" rhetoric has upped to outright insulting other countries, threatening annexation and removing foreign aid funding etc which is souring the positive view of the USA in many countries around the world.
The USA has already lost it's soft power grip on many places and the Chinese are moving in with their Belt and Road Initiative and other economic ties effectively replacing the USA as the main trading partner.
American manufacturing didn't just disappear overnight and it can't just be magiced back overnight either so the idea that new factories will just automatically be built and somehow service the needs of 340 million+ people is delusional. American industry even at it's peak was never capable of fulfilling the needs of 340 million people and people today require a much more diverse range of products than they ever did before. Especially if you include food production there's simply no way to grow certain things like coffee in the USA domestically to any level that would be able ro meet consumer demand.

Assuming you gave the $150k or less discount to everyone (joint filers, single and head of household) instead of cutting the rate in half for single and head of household. Then each of those returns no longer has to pay $16,682 in federal income tax (amount paid by joint filers on $150K), which is $371,680,481,742 total lost tax revenue, or ~$700B total including filers making less than $150K.

z9eGjvozo1I,"anyways heres how to make beef wellington 

Step 1
Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper.
Step 2
Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.
Step 4
To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and season with salt and pepper. Cook until liquid has evaporated and mixture is sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool in fridge. Step 5
Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it’s twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Arrange the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto.
Step 6
Place tenderloin at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).
Step 7
Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry. Step 8
Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.
Step 9
Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and score lightly with a sharp knife. Sprinkle with flaky salt.
Step 10
Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 20 minutes before carving and serving.",0.03775279248,Neutral

ZIVpSUgQSHY,"I wish you would have explained the background for capping the SALT tax at $10,000. 

1) The states with the highest taxes are blue Democrat states.  These states continued to raise taxes year over year. The state government received less push back from constituents because they could deduct this amount from their Federal taxes.  Citizens living in states with no (or lower) state income taxes (majority red Republican states) did not benefit from this Federal deduction. Why should citizens in states that are more efficient and manage their money better pay more in Federal taxes? Without a SALT cap, there is less incentive for states to manage state money better.
2) Persons with more expensive homes and bigger home loans get a bigger mortgage interest reduction which reduces Federal income taxes paid. Why should wealthier persons pay less in Federal taxes than those persons that make less.
3) In order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, you must have a mortgage. Who benefits from a mortgage? Banks and lenders. There is less benefit financially to paying off the mortgage and getting out of debt. Our economy is based on consumer spending and borrowing (versus manufacturing).

What happens when we pay income taxes... the employer takes taxes off our paychecks & the employer has to match the taxes. It no more income taxes are taken and employers don't pay any taxes then trump will charge the people individual tariffs to live in America. We will be paying tariffs on everything we buy or use and we will be paying tariffs on ourselves, our children and our pets and it will be 4x more than the income taxes we've been paying to cover the taxes of the corporation and the wealthy tax breaks.

But anyway not only did Harley survive but Japan got innovative and focused on producing way more 700cc and smaller motorcycles and obviously buyers are not going to want less powerful bikes so the Japanese figured out how to get 750 level power from 650s and 700s inspiring higher performance engine development to where now 600cc engines are making more HP than older 1000cc engines. So it was a win win for everyone but that's not always the case...
