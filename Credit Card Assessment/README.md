# Credit Risk Assessment Project

This project implements a credit risk assessment model using Python and various machine learning techniques.  The goal is to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan, enabling lenders to make more informed decisions.

## Introduction

Credit risk assessment is a critical task for financial institutions.  Accurate predictions of creditworthiness are essential for minimizing losses and maximizing profitability. This project addresses this challenge by developing a predictive model using [mention specific algorithms used, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting].

## Dataset

[Describe the dataset used.  Include the source if publicly available (e.g., Kaggle, UCI).  Mention key features and any preprocessing steps taken.  If the data is not publicly available, explain how it was obtained (e.g., "simulated data," "proprietary data").]  For example:

> The dataset used in this project is the [Dataset Name] dataset, available from [Source]. It contains information about [Number] loan applicants, including features such as [list a few key features, e.g., age, income, loan amount, credit history].  The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables.

## Methodology

[Explain the steps involved in your project.  This should include data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.  Be specific about the techniques used.] For example:

> The project followed a standard machine learning workflow:
>
> 1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values using [mention method, e.g., imputation, removal] and encoded categorical variables using [mention method, e.g., one-hot encoding].
> 2.  **Feature Engineering:** [Mention any new features created, e.g., interaction terms, ratios].
> 3.  **Model Selection:** Explored several models, including [list models].  The best performing model was [mention best model] based on [mention evaluation metric, e.g., AUC, F1-score].
> 4.  **Training and Evaluation:** The model was trained using [mention training data split, e.g., 80% training, 20% testing] and evaluated using [mention metrics].

## Results

[Summarize the key findings and performance of your model.  Include relevant metrics and visualizations if possible.] For example:

> The [best model name] achieved an AUC of [value] on the test set, demonstrating its ability to effectively discriminate between low-risk and high-risk borrowers.  [Optional: Include a brief explanation of the implications of the results].

## Dependencies
